We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log that topics they're interested in and to make
 journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log hom page will describe
 the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user can create
 new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
